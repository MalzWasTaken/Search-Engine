Basic search engine that scrapes through web pages to bring the most relevant to the top

Please install before attempting to run:

pip install rapidfuzz

1. To use, make sure the Videogames folder is in the same folder as the main.py file.

2. Run with python on command prompt and input query

I have used the File path as the URL as there aren't any Actual URL's from the web pages
