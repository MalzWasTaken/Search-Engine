# Search-Engine
Basic search engine that scrapes through web pages to bring the most relevant to the top

Please install before attempting to run:

pip install rapidfuzz
pip install nltk
pip install scikit-learn
pip install beautifulsoup

1. To use, make sure the Videogames folder is in the same folder as the main.py file.

2. Run with python on command prompt and input query

3. There will be a menu that will prompt if you want to use normal serch mode, or experiment mode.

4. Normal search mode searches normally

5. Experiment mode will search with either no preprocessing techniques, stop word removal, lemmatization, or stemming.

I have used the File path as the URL as there aren't any Actual URL's from the web pages
